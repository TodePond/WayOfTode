# Way of Tode
This is the **Way of Tode**!<br>
I like to use it when I code hobby projects.

I don't always follow the Way of Tode.<br>
But when I do, it helps me to do two things:<br>
🐸 Have fun!<br>
🐸 Be fast!<br>

Here's a haiku:
<p align="center">
	<i>sometimes I write code<br>
	like I'm a rigid robot 🤖<br>
	it works pretty well<br>
<br>
	but I much prefer<br>
	to write my code like a tode 🐸<br>
	it's a lot more fun<br></i>
</p>

Keep it simple, humble and fun.
